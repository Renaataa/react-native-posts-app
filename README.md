# react-native-posts-app
List of posts in FlatList.\
You can choose the post to see its details and comments.\
You can delete or update comments.

Description of the task:\
Make a mobile application with a list of post names - 20 posts should be displayed at one page (posts are sent by network request).\
It is possible to update posts - the request is sent again.\
There should be 2 arrows at the bottom to navigate through the pages.\

When you click on a post, a page opens with detailed information for that post.\
And under the post there will be a list of comments to it. There should be a cross next to each comment - when you click on it, the comment will be deleted.\

   
Additionally\
Double clicking on a comment makes it possible to change the text in it (it becomes like an input field and it contains the text of the comment).\
And the save and cancel buttons appear. Changes can either be saved or discarded.\
